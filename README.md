# Overview

This project was a goal to become more familiar with Python Arcade. I wanted to see how the arcade library worked and what the advantages and disadvantages that it offered were. 

This is a short game where you play as a fox trying to get home. Along the way there are acorns to collect. You move by using the arrow keys or WASD. You can use the up arrow key, W, or spacebar to jump. Double jumping is enabled.

# Development Environment

I used VScode to develop this project. I used the library arcade and pyglet. 
Arcade made it possible to make the game and pyglet helped make it more compatable 
to run on mac os.

# Future Work

* Add more complex levels via Tiled
* When jumping the character rotates to the right rather
than continuing to face the current direction. 
* The sound does not currently loop and will end after a minute.
